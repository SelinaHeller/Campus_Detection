# Object Detection for Localization in a Campus Environment
This thesis with the title "Object Detection for Localization in a Campus Environment" presents a custom object detector to complement the localization of vehicles using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and OpenStreetMap data. The detector is based on Faster R-CNN, ResNet, and a pre-trained model provided by the TensorFlow Object Detection API. For the task of localization, a set of landmarks on the campus of the TU Kaiserslautern is identified. These are then divided into classes to create a dataset with which the network is trained. The dataset consists of images, which are generated by the Delivery-Robot of the RRLAB driving two routes on the campus. The network is trained to identify 20 different landmarks, which include buildings, artworks, benches,
entrances, fire hydrants, fitness equipment, and waste bins. The goal is to evaluate the performance of the model and the applicability of the model for localization. To achieve this the model is tested on FINROC and integrated into the existing localization algorithm of Maximilian Kunz of the RRLAB. At last, an outlook on the possible improvements and additions is given.

# Task 
In this thesis, a custom object detector is developed to detect landmarks on the campus of the TU Kaiserslautern. The dataset is produced with the help of the Delivery-Robot and labeled manually. It is investigated, if these landmarks, like buildings and their entrances and numbers, benches, wastebaskets, and fire hydrants, can be successfully detected and be used for the localization of the robot driving on the campus. To achieve this Faster R-CNN is used, utilizing a pre-trained model and ResNet as the backbone, to generate a 2D machine learning detection giving a class tag and confidence for the detection and a bounding box. This can then be converted to a 3D detection based on a point cloud, camera frustum, and the image to get the local position, distance, and angle. The final model to be used in location approaches is saved as a frozen graph and classifies the landmarks in each frame of a video or image.

# Dataset
In preparation for the creation of the dataset used for this thesis, possible classes were considered. These classes should orientate themselves on the landmarks in OSM as well as other well recognizable objects. Landmarks in OSM are visible on the map ![Map of Campus Kaiserslautern](https://github.com/[SelinaHeller]/[Campus_Detection]/blob/[main]/mapTU.pdf?raw=true) and include building entrances, waste bins, hydrants, artwork, benches, fitness stations, and many more. But for this thesis, only the named ones are considered. Also considered are recognizable objects like the types of buildings, since they differ from one another. This means that buildings with numbers in the 40s look alike as well as buildings with their numbers in the 30s and the 10s. A visualization of which buildings belong to which type can be seen on this map ![Edited map of Campus Kaiserslautern](https://github.com/[SelinaHeller]/[Campus_Detection]/blob/[main]/mapTUbearbeitet.pdf?raw=true). Also, some buildings differ from each other and the ones with the
same number range, so they get their own classes, like the central university library, the bistro36, the mensa, and the buildings 42 and 47. Also, the numbers of the buildings can often be seen and be used for localization. On the map a listing of all classes recognizable with this detector can be seen. The dataset is then created by driving the route marked on this map ![Route taken on campus](https://github.com/[SelinaHeller]/[Campus_Detection]/blob/[main]/MapWithRoute.jpg?raw=true) on the campus of the TU Kaiserslautern. The robot used for this task is the Delivery-Robot ![Delivery Robot of the RRLab](https://github.com/[SelinaHeller]/[Campus_Detection]/blob/[main]/PostBot.png?raw=true), which was designed to transport heavy loads on the campus. For this dataset only the possible routes on the outside of buildings are considered since within the buildings are no OSM landmarks that are considered for the localization of the robot at this time. Also, the robot has to be able to drive the possible routes, which means that no points only reachable by stairs are on the route. Since the robot itself is used to generate the image data all of the buildings, which can be reached by the robot on the selected route are covered. The two selected routes are inspired by the most popular paths on the university site, which can be reached by the robot. One from the RRLAB entrance in Building 46 to the Mensa and Building 42 and the other from the RRLAB entrance to Building 11. On these routes, many landmarks, that are marked
in OSM, can be seen and every class considered before is covered.
